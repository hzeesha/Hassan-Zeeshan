### [NBA Match Predictor](https://github.com/hzeesha/NBAmatchPredictor) 

Developed an end-to-end NBA game outcome prediction pipeline using data scraping, feature engineering, and machine learning
*  Data Scraping: Utilized Playwright and BeautifulSoup to scrape NBA box scores and standings from Basketball Reference for seasons 2019-2024.
*  Data Processing: Parsed and structured game statistics into CSV files, incorporating rolling averages to enhance predictive features.
*  Model Training: Trained a Ridge Classifier on historical data and rolling averages, optimizing for accuracy in game outcome predictions.
*  Prediction Interface: Built a user-friendly CLI allowing users to input two teams and predict the winner based on the trained model.
*  Automation: Designed a modular system enabling users to skip scraping and training by providing pre-processed data and trained model files.
*  Tools & Technologies: Implemented using Python, with libraries such as scikit-learn, Playwright, and BeautifulSoup for efficient processing and deployment.
